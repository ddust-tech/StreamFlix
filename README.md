StreamFlix
📖 About the Project

StreamFlix is a simple web project inspired by Netflix’s interface — but completely built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It’s not a clone; it’s my own original design and structure. The project currently includes a Home Page and a Sign-In Page, with more exciting features under development.
